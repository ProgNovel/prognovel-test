      Thanks to the emerging technology Web Monetization API and Interledger protocol, it is possible
      now to provide frictionless shared monthly subscription across all ProgNovel websites (and any
      other Web Monetization websites like Imgur!), paying authors and any other content creators fairly
      based on how much time subscribers spend time enjoying their contents. The frictionless design
      of Web Monetization API inspired us to create affiliate marketing network based on its technology,
      directly baked into browsers without having to rely on big tech backed platforms to do marketing
      heavy lifting for authors! This new approach also can entice influencers and generate a new wave
      of "professional" reviewers to promote the works of fiction authors; long term can help flourishing
      more contents for the community outside the scope of pure fiction writings for the community.
      <br /><br />With the increased efficiency of these new payment technologies soon there will be
      no longer a need for the website owner to act as the gatekeeper for revenues commonly seen
      when using ads network or some subscription options, as reader will be paying directly to
      authors and contributors without unncessarily compex setup on the website's backend, allowing
      more healthy collaborations to flourish that based on trust.

      ProgNovel joins the ranks of pioneers of modern web app by providing fully installable experience
      on mobile and desktop. By default, ProgNovel works offline even if readers haven't been installing
      it, while providing an easy way to store content offline with a single click of download button.
      <br /><br />
      Installed ProgNovel apps can be easily accessed by the desktop and homescreen. And in addition
      to this, ProgNovel site owners can configure UX benefits for readers with installed ProgNovel apps,
      such as cutting ads waiting time (if any) and chapters update notify badge both in mobile and windows
      desktop. These can ultimately improve engagement and user loyalty in the long run.

      have yet able to deliver. With the simplicity of its architecture design and further optimization
      along the road, your free-to-host ProgNovel sites will be much faster than sites that cost $10k
      a month hosted on cloud providers!
