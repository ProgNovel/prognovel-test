I'm happy to announce that ProgNovel has been officially joined as a Spark grantee of Grant for the Web. ProgNovel received $15,000 fund for 6 months duration to develop ProgNovel source code to its official publish to the public by the end of 2021 year.

The fund will be used to refresh the much needed hardware for ProgNovel, such as development machines to develop PWA that cover macOS, Windows, Android, and so on. The fund also will be very helpful for me to commit on working for ProgNovel full-time. The development for ProgNovel hasn't been smooth for quite some time due to my laptop performance restriction on Windows 10, which currently I could partially mitigate by migrating to Linux Ubuntu instead. During the grant duration ProgNovel development will be much stable with better machines that could handle NodeJS project that has been slowly accumulate tech debt for some time, which often reach the limit of my current 4GB of RAM laptop without SSD could handle.

Grant for the Web grant for ProgNovel will decide the future of ProgNovel, and I'm very grateful for the grant comitee to let me join other grantees to help building the next generation monetization technology on the web.
