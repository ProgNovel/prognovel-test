ProgNovel is built to help authors and other content creators, translators, small publishers, to publish modern content at no or very little cost. It is not meant a "free but limited feature" product, monetizing ProgNovel is not the goal of this project. ProgNovel is designed to be accessible for everyone without any capital required except effort, creativity, and desire to tell stories to the world. ProgNovel source codes will be always accessible for free to self-host.

ProgNovel strives to be the most cost-effective as possible, using the least resource to host but at the same time enabling "little guys" creators to launch world class platform to compete with even venture capital backed companies, decentralizing the already decaying of web publishing by giving back power to creators instead of company executives.

ProgNovel is meant to be free to use. Any features meant to be used for content creators should not be paywalled in ProgNovel. Any form of monetization to support ProgNovel's developers and project contributors shall be only in form of donation, or revenue sharing, or other methods that are not meant to burden creators from creating cool things with it.

ProgNovel is putting great user experience first. Unless not compatible with our core value, anything that frustrate user bases should be eliminated and fixed if possible.

ProgNovel has mission to create the world beyond papel novel. Javascript interactivity and internet connectivity offer a great number of ways to create stories that leave readers in delight. We should explore the uncharted territory of the next generation form of storytelling that is web novel, which is not just a mere novel on the web.
